Sentiment-Analysis-using-R
==========================

Sentiment analysis or opinion mining is one of the most basic methods to classify a text document subjectively.
This code sequence gives you a walk through in sentiment analysis using R. I have coded these functions as a part of an ongoing bigger project.
Kindly point out any modifications which you can suggest.

If you are looking for running a basic sentiment analysis,use the codes given in "code" folder.

Step 1:
Put all the 4 codes in the same directory.

Step 2:
Save your input text file as "input.txt" in the same directory as your codes.

Step 3:
run: sentiment(directory=directory address)
